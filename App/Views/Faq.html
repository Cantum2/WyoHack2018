        <h2>How will this solution generate revenue to pay the independent music artists?</h2>
        <p>We provide a pay-per-play rate better than Spotify and Soundcloud. This is accomplished using a universal basic income model and silent advertising. Powered by blockchain, we  provide multiple avenues for users to earn revenue for their favorite artists. It would be up to the user to choose whichever is most convenient. </p>
